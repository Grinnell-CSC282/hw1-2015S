Unix Tools:

Filesystem traversal:
cd - change directory
diff - compare two files
mkdir - make a directory
mv - move a file or rename in place
df - view extra directory information (-h flag is useful)
ls - list files in a directory (use -l to get permissions, size)
pwd - short for "print working directory" and used to find where you are
chmod - changes the permissions of a file (use +x to make it executable)
rm - remove a file (bradyjoh uses -rf to remove entire directories)


man <utility> - look up usage information and similar commands. Use a 
	number as a flag right after "man" to look up information for different 
	commands named the same thing.
nano - CLI text editor (CTRL+X and then CTRL+Y and then ENTER to exit)
ssh - connect to another computer's command line
make - runs the Makefile in the directory, allowing for easier scripting of
	code compilation.
tr - replaces or removes characters from input

| - (pipe) take one command's CLI output and "pipe" it to another command 
	to be used as input.
> - sends a command's CLI output to a file, overwriting anything prior
>> - sends CLI output to a file, appending to the end of the file if it 
	already exists.
