Useful Unix Utils
=================

Herein you will find a variety of utility programs commonly available on
Unix systems and some notes as to why you might want to use them.  You can,
of course, learn more about each by using `man`.

Simple Text Utilities
---------------------

### `tr` - translate characters

`tr` is useful for character-based code modifications.  It lets you do
single-character changes or deletions (for every character in a set).

* `tr -d string1` - Deletes every character in `string1` from stdin
* `tr 'a' 'A'`

### `sed` - stream editor for filtering and transforming strings of text (man)

* `sed` 's/regex/replacement/g' infile > outfile` - replace all instances of
  matching regex with replacement, read from infile and written to outfile
 
Scripting Languages
-------------------

### `perl` - practical extraction and report language

A hugely powerful language, originally designed as a tool for sysadmins.
Really nice for hacking out quick text manipulation scripts; not always
nice for building large, maintainable software packages.  (It doesn't help
that there are usually a dozen ways to accomplish any one topic in Perl.)

### `awk` - pattern-directed scanning and processing language (from man)

Awk (or gawk for GNU awk) is kind of similar to Perl. It makes it easy to
extract column data separated by delimiters. Awk also allows one to write
code on the command line using curly brackets, like so: 
`gawk -F ',' '{ if ($1 > 0) print$2}'`.
This piece of code tokenizes strings separated by commas and prints out the
second column if the first one is greater that 0.

Tools for C Programmers
-----------------------

### `gdb` - The GNU debugger

A nice, text-based debugger for C (and some other languages).  Sam will
cover this later in the semester.

### `valgrind` - a memory leak detection tool

Filesystem Traversal:
---------------------

* cd - change directory
* diff - compare two files
* mkdir - make a directory
* mv - move a file or rename in place
* df - view extra directory information (-h flag is useful)
* ls - list files in a directory (use -l to get permissions, size)
* pwd - short for "print working directory" and used to find where you are
* chmod - changes the permissions of a file (use +x to make it executable)
* rm - remove a file (bradyjoh uses -rf to remove entire directories)

* man <utility> - look up usage information and similar commands. Use a 
	number as a flag right after "man" to look up information for different 
	commands named the same thing.
* lynx - text-based web browser
* nano - CLI text editor (CTRL+X and then CTRL+Y and then ENTER to exit)
* ssh - connect to another computer's command line
* sshfs - locally mount a directory from a remote file system
* write <username> - once you ssh into a computer someone is using, you can
	use write to communicate with them in terminal
* who - lists all users logged in on this machine
* make - runs the Makefile in the directory, allowing for easier scripting of
	code compilation.

* | - (pipe) take one command's CLI output and "pipe" it to another command 
	to be used as input.
* > - sends a command's CLI output to a file, overwriting anything prior
* >> - sends CLI output to a file, appending to the end of the file if it 
	already exists.
* grep (regex) - prints lines matching a pattern 

Git:
----

* git init - 
* git clone -
* git status - 
* git commit - 
* git add - 
* git push - 
* git diff -
