1.	Given a DOS-formatted text file (lines end with \r\n rather than just \n), convert it to a standard text file.
    
    Solution: sed 's/.$//'

5.	Given a CSV file in which each line has the form: LastName,FirstName,Assignment,NumericGrade, find the five           highest grades on homework 2.

    I found out about something called grep while looking for a solution to this problem on here http://stackoverflow     .com/questions/16956810/finding-all-files-containing-a-text-string-on-linux
    I then proceeded to find out more about it. Turns out grep is a command-line utility that matches text in a file      by searching the lines in the file (http://tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/html/sect_04_02.html). I do not fully     understand its purpose though. I think if we can identify the lines with homework 2 as the assignment name, we        could find a way to sort this lines according to the numeric grade, then look at the value of the five highest        numeric grades.

6.	Given an HTML file, find the URLs of all images. In case you don't know HTML, those will typically look like 
    <img ... src="*URL*" ...> 
    The img can have any capitalization (img, IMG, Img, iMg, etc.)
    There can be other text between the img and the src. (That text cannot include a greater than sign.)
    You may find it easier to start this problem by assuming that there's only one image tag on a line.

    Solution: wget -prA.png
