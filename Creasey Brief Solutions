1. Given a DOS-formatted text file (lines end with \r\n rather than just \n), convert it to a standard text file.

There are a bunch of solutions for this here: http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/maverick/man1/dos2unix.1.html.
Each solution gets the job done but with a slight twist or variation in each method. Unix


2. Given a standard text file, convert all uppercase letters to lowercase.
Solution: http://linuxcommando.blogspot.com/2008/05/how-to-convert-text-files-to-all-upper.html
Two Sample solutions for to lower-case: 
$ dd if=input.txt of=output.txt conv=lcase
$ perl -pe '$_= lc($_)' input.txt > output.txt

To All Upper: 
perl
$ perl -pe '$_= uc($_)' input.txt > output.txt


3. Given a standard text file, remove all blank spaces at the end of lines.

Solution found here: http://www.unixguide.net/unix/sedoneliner.shtml

# delete trailing whitespace (spaces, tabs) from end of each line 
sed 's/[ \t]*$//' # see note on '\t' at end of file


4. Make a list of all misspelled words in a text file.
Solution from: http://www.westwind.com/reference/os-x/commandline/pipes.html
This command will list the misspelled words: 
tr 'A-Z' 'a-z' <fnord.txt | tr -cs 'a-z' '\n' | sort | uniq | comm -23 - /usr/share/dict/words




5. Given a CSV file in which each line has the form
LastName,FirstName,Assignment,NumericGrade 
find the the five highest grades on homework 2.

My thought for this is to somehow select the “homework 2” column, then sort the scores and return the top 5 scores. Simple to say, though I have no idea how it would be done. I need to sleep. 


6. Given an HTML file, find the URLs of all images. In case you don't know HTML, those will typically look like 
<img ... src="*URL*" ...>
The img can have any capitalization (img, IMG, Img, iMg, etc.)
There can be other text between the img and the src. (That text cannot include a greater than sign.)
You may find it easier to start this problem by assuming that there's only one image tag on a line.
