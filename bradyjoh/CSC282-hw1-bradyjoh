Make a list of all misspelled words in a text file.

Given a CSV file in which each line has the form
LastName,FirstName,Assignment,NumericGrade 
find the the five highest grades on homework 2.

Given an HTML file, find the URLs of all images. In case you don't know HTML, those will typically look like 
<img ... src="*URL*" ...>
The img can have any capitalization (img, IMG, Img, iMg, etc.)
There can be other text between the img and the src. (That text cannot include a greater than sign.)
You may find it easier to start this problem by assuming that there's only one image tag on a line.
